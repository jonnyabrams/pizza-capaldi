A Peter Capaldi-themed pizza delivery website, built using TypeScript, React, NextJS, MongoDB, Cloudinary and PayPal integration.

Users can order a range of pizzas, dynamically priced by size and extra toppings, and checkout using either PayPal (I'm using a sandbox account in the video demo) or cash delivery. They are then taken to an order confirmation page, where the delivery status can be progressed by admin.

There is also a form for adding a new pizza available to logged-in admin.
